//! A scheduler for driving a large number of futures.
//!
//! Unicycle provides a collection of [Unordered] types:
//!
//! * [FuturesUnordered]
//! * [StreamsUnordered]
//! * [IndexedStreamsUnordered]
//!
//! These are async abstractions that runs a set of futures or streams which may
//! complete in any order.
//! Similarly to [FuturesUnordered][futures-rs] from the [futures crate].
//! But we aim to provide a stronger guarantee of fairness (see below), and
//! better memory locality for the futures being pollled.
//!
//! **Note:** This project is experimental. It involves some amount of unsafe and
//! possibly bad assumptions which needs to be either vetted or removed before you
//! should consider putting it in production.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! * `parking-lot` - To enable locking using the [parking_lot] crate (default).
//! * `futures-rs` - Enable the used of the Stream type from [futures-rs].
//!   This is required to get access to [StreamsUnordered] and
//!   [IndexedStreamsUnordered] since these wrap over [futures-rs] types. (default)
//!
//! [parking_lot]: https://crates.io/crates/parking_lot
//! [futures-rs]: https://crates.io/crates/futures
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use tokio::time;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//! use unicycle::FuturesUnordered;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     let mut futures = FuturesUnordered::new();
//!
//!     futures.push(time::delay_for(Duration::from_secs(2)));
//!     futures.push(time::delay_for(Duration::from_secs(3)));
//!     futures.push(time::delay_for(Duration::from_secs(1)));
//!
//!     while let Some(_) = futures.next().await {
//!         println!("tick");
//!     }
//!
//!     println!("done!");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! [Unordered] types can be created from iterators:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use tokio::time;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//! use unicycle::FuturesUnordered;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     let mut futures = Vec::new();
//!
//!     futures.push(time::delay_for(Duration::from_secs(2)));
//!     futures.push(time::delay_for(Duration::from_secs(3)));
//!     futures.push(time::delay_for(Duration::from_secs(1)));
//!
//!     let mut futures = futures.into_iter().collect::<FuturesUnordered<_>>();
//!
//!     while let Some(_) = futures.next().await {
//!         println!("tick");
//!     }
//!
//!     println!("done!");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Fairness
//!
//! You can think of abstractions like Unicycle as schedulers. They are provided a
//! set of child tasks, and try to do their best to drive them to completion. In
//! this regard, it's interesting to talk about _fairness_ in how the tasks are
//! being driven.
//!
//! The current implementation of [FuturesUnordered][futures-rs] maintains a queue
//! of tasks interested in waking up. As a task is woken up, it's added to the head
//! of this queue to signal its interest.
//! When [FuturesUnordered][futures-rs] is being polled, it drains this queue in a
//! loop and polls the associated task.
//! This process has a side effect of tasks who aggressively signal interest in
//! waking up will receive priority and be polled more frequently, since there is a
//! higher chance that while the queue is being drained, their interest will be
//! re-added to the queue.
//! This can lead to instances where a small number of tasks can can cause the
//! polling loop of [FuturesUnordered][futures-rs] to [spin abnormally].
//! This issue was [reported by Jon Gjengset], and improved on by [limiting the
//! amount FuturesUnordered is allowed to spin].
//!
//! Unicycle addresses this by limiting how frequently a child task may be polled
//! per _polling cycle_.
//! This is done by tracking polling interest in two separate sets.
//! Once we are polled, we swap out the active set, then take the swapped out set
//! and use as a basis for what to poll in order, but we limit ourselves to only
//! poll _once_ per child task.
//! Additional wakeups are only registered in the swapped in set which will be
//! polled the next cycle.
//!
//! This way we hope to achieve a higher degree of fairness, never favoring the
//! behavior of one particular task.
//!

//! [limiting the amount FuturesUnordered is allowed to spin]: https://github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/pull/2049
//! [reported by Jon Gjengset]: https://github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/issues/2047
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The [Unordered] type stores all futures being polled in a [PinSlab] (Inspired by
//! the [slab] crate).
//! A slab is capable of utomatically reclaiming storage at low cost, and will
//! maintain decent memory locality.
//! A [PinSlab] is different from a [Slab] in how it allocates the memory regions it
//! uses to store objects.
//! While a regular [Slab] is simply backed by a vector which grows as appropriate,
//! this approach is not viable for pinning, since it would cause the objects to
//! move while being reallocated.
//! Instead [PinSlab] maintains a growable collection of fixed-size memory regions,
//! allowing it to store and reference immovable objects through the [pin API].
//! Each future inserted into the slab is assigned an _index_, which we will be
//! using below.
//! We now call the inserted future a _task_, and you can think of this index as a
//! unique task identifier.
//!
//! Next to the slab we maintain two [bit sets], one _active_ and one _alternate_.
//! When a task registers interest in waking up, the bit associated with its index
//! is set in the active set, and the latest waker passed into [Unordered] is called
//! to wake it up.
//! Once [Unordered] is polled, it atomically swaps the active and alternate
//! [bit sets], waits until it has exclusive access to the now _alternate_ [BitSet],
//! and drains it from all the indexes which have been flagged to determine which
//! tasks to poll.
//! Each task is then polled _once_ in order.
//! If the task is [Ready], its result is yielded.
//! After we receive control again, we continue draining the alternate set in this
//! manner, until it is empty.
//! When this is done we yield once, then we start the cycle over again.
